# Features of the Portfolio Site

### Project Showcase:

Create a section where you showcase your recent projects. Include project names, brief descriptions, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories. This allows visitors to see your work at a glance.

### Dynamic Theming:

Implement a dark and light theme toggle for your portfolio. This feature enhances user experience and provides a personalized touch to your site.

### Contact Form:

Include a contact form or provide your email address for visitors to reach out to you. This adds an interactive element, allowing potential employers or collaborators to connect with you easily.

### Live Link: https://shakilhossain-sigma.vercel.app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
